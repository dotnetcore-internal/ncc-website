WebApiClientCore.Analyzers provides syntax analysis and prompts for interface declarations to help developers avoid improper syntax when declaring interfaces.

- In version 1.x, the interface needs to inherit from IHttpApi to get the syntax analysis prompt.
- In versions after 2.0, the interface can also get the syntax analysis prompt without inheriting from IHttpApi.
