EasyCaching.Memcached is a memcached caching lib which is based on **EasyCaching.Core** and **[EnyimMemcachedCore](https://github.com/cnblogs/EnyimMemcachedCore)**.

When you use this lib, it means that you will handle the data of your memcached servers. As usual, we will use it as distributed caching.
