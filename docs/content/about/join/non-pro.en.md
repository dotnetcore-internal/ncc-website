The answers to technical questions often exist beyond the realm of technology, and technical professionals are often troubled by non-technical issues - health problems, labor disputes, copyright issues, marital conflicts... 

All of these require professionals from various fields in society to help guide and navigate the way for technical individuals.

As the saying goes, each profession has its own specialization, and the path to enlightenment has its own sequence. A diverse community opens its doors to people from all walks of life, and technology should not be a barrier.

The NCC community was originally created for everyone to work together, making the lives of technical professionals more interesting.
