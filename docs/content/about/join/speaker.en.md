If we compare the community to a marketplace, then technology is the resource that circulates in this market.

Sharing experiences in the field of technology not only increases one's visibility and reputation in the technical community but also allows for finding like-minded friends, mutual learning, and collective growth. It is said that "teaching benefits both the teacher and the student."

The NCC community is willing to build this stage for everyone. 

Here are some relevant resources:

- Seek contact from any member of [TheNCC PMC](/people/project-management-committee).
