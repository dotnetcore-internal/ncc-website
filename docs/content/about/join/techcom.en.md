Where there are people, there is a community, and where there is a community, there are factions. When factions communicate and collaborate with each other, the community becomes vibrant.

Through communication and collaboration among technical communities, we can help each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and seek common ground while respecting differences.

Technical communities are communities of technology, and the exchange between communities helps to restrain the spread of non-technical and irrational factors, making the community peaceful and far-reaching.

The NCC community is willing to cooperate with other technical communities to build a larger stage for developers. Here are some relevant resources:

- Seek contact from any member of [TheNCC PMC](/people/project-management-committee).

- [Contact us](/about/contact), includes the community's external email address.
