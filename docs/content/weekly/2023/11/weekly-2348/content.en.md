# Weekly Comments

In the 48th week, with the return of Altman, the farce of OpenAI finally came to an end - perhaps there will be new plot in the future, but for now, Altman's victory has made Nadella the biggest winner, and also given the technology writers and publishers who are struggling with the exhaustion of materials new materials to supplement the biographies of all kinds of bigwigs who are tired of writing, and at the same time, it has provided domestic melon-eating masses with a Hollywood blockbuster... Yes, the whole farce is so much like a movie with a complete script and script that it has raised many speculations...

The return of Altman brings hope to OpenAI, but it may not be so for all of humanity. Adherents of e/acc. (Effective Accelerationism), such as Altman of OpenAI, generally emphasize the promotion and transformation of technology innovation to society. They believe that technology is developing at an unstoppable rate of acceleration; in the technological age, people should make the most of the power of innovation and technology to drive social change.

With the rise of GPT, e/acc. has been accepted by many bigwigs, and more and more people have noticed this concept. It only took less than two years from the AI winter to the recovery of everything and the blooming of millions of LLM, so e/acc. has been endowed with more, more specific and more realistic significance.

They believe that any technology that is beneficial to humanity, can bring benefits to humanity, and is imaginative should be supported. No matter how exaggerated, ridiculous, absurd, or distant they may seem, they should not be denied, as they are all potentially achievable. In my opinion, this perspective is too radical and overly reliant on technology, as if major technological breakthroughs alone can change the various contradictions that already exist in modern societyâ€”both internal and external contradictions. It seems to suggest that the fate of the world or the destiny of humanity is placed in the hands of non-human entities through a disruptive technology.

This is unacceptable to me.

Uncontrolled AI is unacceptable, and humans must always keep their fate in their own hands, which is not human supremacism. e/acc. is popular now because the generative AI emerged as a paradigm-changing technology, making them see the possibility of the arrival of "disruptive technology" - generative AI is the "disruptive technology" they have been searching for. They believe that the development of general artificial intelligence should be absolutely supported (without the addition of love for humanity or the three rules of robotics). Instead of slowing down the development of AI, it is better to unite to exert more positive influences of AI and reduce negative impacts. Although it has certain potential dangers, the urgent pursuit of general AI is an inevitable requirement for the forward development of all human society...

I seem to see the shadow of the "Great Academy of Human Sciences"... Although the fans of e/acc. believe that AI has a universal nature and cannot be in the hands of a few people, but "more people should participate in it." But the question is whether ordinary people have the ability and sufficient resources to participate. To what extent does this "universal benefit" work? Is it conducive to building a community with a shared future for mankind...?

If only those who have more resources are allowed to participate and share the "universal benefit" cake, then it is no different from the "sharing of interests" proposed by the great powers after invading China. Taking the cake from a small group of people and allowing more (but still a small part of humanity) small groups of people to share it would simply become a republican system of "Great Academy of Sciences/Science Nobility". This is also unacceptable.

Although "Effective Acceleration" (e/acc.) considers the issues of technology and the future of humanity from the perspective of the well-being of all humanity, the risks of moving forward are still too great. Before e/acc., should we take a further step towards Super Alignment? Compared to the speed of human development, the "existence" of human future is a more important topic, isn't it?

Perhaps we cannot see the seeds of certain desperation at the moment, but the story of these seeds has long been buried in the pens of visionaries.

Perhaps the future of humanity is bright, and of course we believe this - but precisely because of this, we should maintain the most cautious attitude towards AI. Nuclear weapons are still tangible and controllable, while artificial intelligence is "all-embracing and ubiquitous"...

Let the "Great Dark Age" not become our era.
