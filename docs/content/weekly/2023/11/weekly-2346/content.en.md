# Weekly Comments

Good morning, everyone, in the 46th week.

.NET Conf 2023 is coming soon, and .NET Conf China 2023 is also preparing and implementing intensively. This year's conference will be held in Beijing. Are you ready?

This week's weekly review, I want to focus on "achievement and reality", which is also something that many people are confused about. Many technicians actually have some kind of ideal or dream, which can be seen from their obsession with technology. These ideals and dreams bring a sense of achievement that can only be experienced and difficult to explain during the process of pursuing and advancing.

However, reality is often skinny and often exceeds our expectations; or it always develops in the worst case we expected, which is Murphy's Law. For example, the development of a community, unless the development momentum has formed an inertia (such as Apache or CNCF), otherwise, the resistance is often greater than the driving force, and the force moving forward is always smaller than the force pulling backward. This can be seen in any technology community, and for the .NET community (China), due to well-known reasons, it becomes a bit conspicuous.

> For example, if a certain event registration service always encounters various accidents before the event, should we continue to use our custom service or look for a third-party platform to ensure the smooth execution of the event? The ideal may be good, we can add various functions to the registration system, and then develop it into a vertical platform for online events in a certain field... But in reality, due to instability, it will instead delay the implementation of the event itself.

Between ideals and reality, between a sense of accomplishment and the challenges we face, we need to find a balance. There are many methodologies to find this balance, but ultimately it comes down to understanding the primary contradictions and the primary aspects of those contradictions, and then allocating resources appropriately, seeking an ideal path, and formulating the best strategies.

> Taking the recent release plan of ESLint 9.0.0 as an example, due to the inclusion of significant breaking changes in version 9.0.0, the ESLint team has decided to execute the release in two stages: ‚ë† The first stage (Alpha) includes the most disruptive changes, allowing the ecosystem to upgrade early and enabling the ESLint team to gather feedback. This is followed by ‚ë° the second stage (Beta), where the remaining breaking changes are implemented to further minimize the impact on the ecosystem. By conducting the release in two phases, the ESLint team aims to achieve the initial design goals of ESLint 9.0.0 while reducing the disruption to the ecosystem and users.

> Another example is TheNCC. TheNCC is committed to being a non-profit, technologically neutral open-source community, with clear rules regarding commercialization and political barriers. This ensures that "open-source remains open-source, and commercial aspects remain commercial." However, in the future, I believe that the community's "commercial barrier regulations" will continue to be adjusted, seeking a new balance between open-source and commercial interests and providing more convenience for the commercialization of member projects.

When confronted with **the attacks of the evil forces in the .NET community**, TheNCC has always adhered to the principle of developer-centered, keeping a low profile and silent in the past three years. It only issued a condemnation statement when member projects and their core personnel were attacked without cause, in order to avoid the community's proactive actions interfering with or affecting the legitimate and reasonable interests of other member projects. However, in the face of unprovoked, persistent, and shameless malicious attacks for many years, TheNCC has begun to respond in a limited manner to ensure the interests of all community members and all member projects.

Community is the community of the community, dreams are the dreams of dreamers, and reality is the reality of workers.

When I talked with Haoyang LIU in the morning about a sense of achievement, I couldn't help sighing that with the support of a big Internet company platform, a person's vitality would be obviously different. They would be more confident and confident, and with the support of platform resources, the speed and space for progress would be much larger than those in small workshops, and the sense of achievement would be self-evident.

EvenHorizon said, "If you don't feel a sense of achievement in your work and it's just about making money, you won't feel satisfied spiritually and will feel passive." I deeply agree. If there is no intersection between work and dreams, then one must prevail over the other; if there is an intersection between work and dreams, then perhaps a win-win situation can be achieved, resulting in twice the sense of achievement; if work itself is the dream, then it's not simply a win-win situation, but "winning twice," maximizing the sense of achievement üòÅüòÅ.

LIU emphasized the importance of favorable timing, geographical location, and human harmony, which I deeply agree with.

Times create people, platforms nurture people, and people encourage themselves. When all three are met, "if I still can't handle things, it's because I'm too bad," LIU said.

Last night, I saw ÁôæÂ∞èÂÉß mention Furion's commercialization path, which once again confirmed this point. Between reality and dreams, how can we find a balance point? Some open source projects are struggling to find the feasibility of dual licensing, some open source projects have already figured out the way to commercialization, and some open source projects have already opened their steps forward on the commercialization path... This is "favorable timing, geographical location, and human harmony" - without losing favorable timing, without losing geographical advantage, and achieving harmony among people can ensure that everything is successful (ËçÄÂ≠ê¬∑ÁéãÈú∏ÁØá), among which "human harmony" specifically refers to the unity of people's hearts and upper and lower levels.
