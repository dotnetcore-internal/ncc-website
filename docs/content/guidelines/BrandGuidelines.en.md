# Welcome to the use of our community's brand assets

Please use the NCC community's brand assets responsibly under the guidance of this guide. Consistent use of our design patterns, logo, and other brand assets helps people easily recognize us.

- The brand assets referred to in this guide include, but are not limited to, the name, logo, icons, slogans, colors, fonts, design patterns, and other visual elements of the NCC community.
- However, this does not include the brand assets of member projects, including the names, logos, icons, slogans, colors, fonts, design patterns, and other visual elements of member projects. The usage guidelines for member project brand assets are determined by their respective project management committees.
- There is one exception: when the name of a member project is combined with NCC or used in conjunction with NCC brand assets, it should follow this guide.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
