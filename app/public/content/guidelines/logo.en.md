## Logo

Our logo represents our community organization, as well as the member projects, community members, open-source community organizations we collaborate with, and developers who support us. It is important to use our community logo correctly so that people can recognize us.

Our logo comes in two versions: the **Classic** version and the **Design** version, and both versions are equally valid.

Therefore, you can choose the appropriate logo version based on the usage scenario and design.

Our black and white variant of the logo is primarily used when the full-color logo cannot be used, including:

In some special occasions, we have also designed variant logos with different primary color schemes.

Please try to avoid using these variant logos and prioritize the primary logo.
