When a project leaves TheNCC community:

- The project type will be referred to as a "Past Project";
- NCC will no longer provide ==any membership project services== for the project, except to assist in transitioning the project to the next stage;
- ThePast Project will no longer be retained in the NCC member project list, but will only be recorded here;
- The NCC will no longer provide marketing and promotion services for the project.

Any project that has become a "Past Project" can be proposed to return to the NCC through the normal project application process. The past project is no longer hosted under The NCC, and their subsequent development and project behavior will be determined by the project maintainers themselves, and have nothing to do with The NCC community.
