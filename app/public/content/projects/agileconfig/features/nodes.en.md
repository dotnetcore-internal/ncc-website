AgileConfig supports multi-node deployment, and all nodes are parallel.

To simplify the deployment, AgileConfig does not have a separate console program. Please directly use any node as the console. When the environment variable `adminConsole=true`, the node has both data node and console functions.

In order for the console to manage nodes, it is necessary to configure node information in the console.
