This project is a work item of the ASP.NET Core Documentaction translation plan. Non-members of this project should not directly push Pull Request to the repository (external contributions are not accepted before the official release).

The official release address of the Simplified Chinese translation documents is not publicly available for the time being.

## Translation Plan

The .NET Core RC2 was released as scheduled in mid-May, so we decided to translate the ASP.NET Core documents. We published recruitment information for the translation plan in the group of Mr. He Zhenxi, Mr. Bei Meng, Mr. Zhang Renjian, and Mr. Leonard, and gathered a group of friends to translate the documents starting in June. So far, the first two chapters have been completed and will be published chapter by chapter according to the plan. When the translation plan is completed, all documents will be integrated into an online reading site, providing epub and pdf versions.

The official Core documents are still being updated, and we will also continue to update the documents.
