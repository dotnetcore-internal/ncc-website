Once a project is archived:

- NCC will no longer provide ==full membership project services== for the project, except transition services such as documentation updates to help transition users;
- Archived projects will still be retained in the NCC community member project list;
- The NCC marketing and event activities will no longer be provided for the project.

In addition, any project that has been archived can be reactivated into NCC through the normal project proposal process. The archived project will continue to be hosted under The NCC, and maintainers are welcome to continue working on the project if they wish to do so.
