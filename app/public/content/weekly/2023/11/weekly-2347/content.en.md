# Weekly Comments

In the 47th week, the biggest event in the .NET technology community was the .NET Conf '23 US, where the release of .NET 8.0 and C# 12 was announced. With the release of .NET 8.0 (and C# 12) as LTS (Long-Term Support) versions, the official ecosystem, including ASP.NET Core 8, EntityFramework Core 8, and a range of products such as Blazor, SignalR, and MAUI, has been revitalized, taking the .NET ecosystem to new heights.

The vigorous development of Cloud Native has also aroused Microsoft's envy. The preview version of .NET Aspire, which has been officially released from the tye project, tells developers in a "symbolism greater than practicality" posture that .NET has not moved away from Cloud Native. Although .NET Aspire is in the preview stage and currently only has research value (without production value and development value), it is rumored that GA will be released in the first half of next year, and we are also looking forward to it. How much surprise will the official version of .NET Aspire bring us? How much vitality can it bring to Cloud Native and how much driving force can it generate for the .NET technology stack to enter the Cloud Native market? This kind of vision and expectation may be the greatest value brought by the preview version of .NET Aspire.

Microsoft's biggest problem when it comes to non-commercial topics is not its inability to introduce exciting technologies, but the problem of "strong Microsoft, weak community" caused by its desire to handle everything itself. Microsoft should focus on .NET technology and its ecological base, and return the community to the community. The role of the community is not only to strengthen the open-source ecosystem of .NET, but its greater role lies in cultivating talents, whose strategic value is far greater than the ecosystem.

Microsoft takes care of the technical ecology all by itself, always wanting to "redefine" the projects of the community's senior leaders from an "official" perspective, coupled and integrated into the ecological base, and use its official status to squeeze out the efforts of the private community. This will inevitably lead to the senior leaders being forced to leave their hometowns and go to other technical stacks to enrich other ecosystems (any code can be written). The resulting consequences are also clear.

From a productivity perspective, whether a technology can be applied in practice depends on whether it can effectively reduce production costs and improve production efficiency, not whether it is officially released. As both the legislator (ecological base) and the enforcer (upper-level application ecology), the decline of the .NET technology stack is an inevitable historical trend and will also be a historical inevitability.

Returning the community to the community and providing space for talent cultivation is the right thing that the ecological base operator should do.
