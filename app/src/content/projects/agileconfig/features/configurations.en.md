After configuring the application information, you can configure configuration items for each application:

- Configuration items support grouping;
- Newly added configurations will not be perceived by the client and need to be manually clicked on "Go Live" to be pushed to the client;
- If the configurations that have gone live are modified, deleted, or rolled back, they will be pushed to the client in real time;
- Version history records the historical information of the configuration, and you can roll back to any version.
