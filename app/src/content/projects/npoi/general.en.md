This project is migrated from TonyQu's [NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi) by .NET Core Community.

NPOI is the .NET version of POI Java project at http://poi.apache.org/. POI is an open source project which can help you read/write xls, doc, ppt files. It has a wide application.

For example, you can use it to
* generate a Excel report without Microsoft Office suite installed on your server and more efficient than call Microsoft Excel ActiveX at background;
* extract text from Office documents to help you implement full-text indexing feature (most of time this feature is used to create search engines).
* extract images from Office documents
* generate Excel sheets that contains formulas
